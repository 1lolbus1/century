Design document(ish)

Century Club rules:

Drinking marathon game where you drink an ounce of beer every minute for 100 minutes

Idea: 

Every 60 seconds for 100 minutes, play a soundeffect at random from a collection
(maybe add requests here too) to indicate the time to take a drink. between each minute marker,
play a song at random from a collection of songs, and starting at a random timestamp.

Using a small django frontend with just an input bar and a "go" button, allow players to request songs and
sound effects. Front end will report errors to user after submission (already in queue, already played,
bad url ect) or a success screen if successful.

After a quick google, it looks like the pafy library would be the best option for us. It streams youtube 
videos in vlc, and this makes my old code able to morph easily to fit this.

Old version's idea:

The old version's (2016/2017 NYE) used a collection of songs and soundeffects manually downloaded and played
on vlc player
